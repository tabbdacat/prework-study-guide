# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was completed as a way to practice using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript to develop a webpage. I learned about the purpose of each language as well as practiced using basic principles of each language. This webpage was developed as a way to organize and view my notes about each coding language.
